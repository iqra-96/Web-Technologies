        Although he was tiny, he had <em>very big dreams</em>. 
        He wanted to explore the world beyond the forest.

        One day, the rabbit met a <mark>wise old turtle</mark> who taught him an important lesson. 
        "Move forward step by step," said the turtle. <br>
        The rabbit learned that courage and patience make you stronger.
